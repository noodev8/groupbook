Kitchen Ready
Run group bookings like a pro

Stop juggling WhatsApp messages, scattered emails, and last-minute changes. Kitchen Ready gives restaurants one simple page per booking — guests add themselves, you stay in control.

The problem you know too well

Group bookings should be easy money.
Instead, they're an admin nightmare.

→ Guest lists arrive incomplete — or not at all
→ Food orders come through six different channels
→ Staff spend hours chasing confirmations
→ The kitchen gets a mess of conflicting info
→ Mistakes hurt your margin and your reputation

You didn't open a restaurant to manage spreadsheets.

How Kitchen Ready works

1. Create an event
   Name, date, cutoff time — done in 30 seconds.

2. Share one link
   Send it to the organiser. They forward it to the group.

3. Guests add themselves
   Names, food orders, dietary requirements — all in one place.

4. You see everything
   Clean guest list, ready for service. Lock it when you're done.

No spreadsheets. No chasing. No confusion.
